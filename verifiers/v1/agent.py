        another agent's interaction, a game engine, a scripted closure, a human.

        The task's shape says who speaks first: a prompt-less task is opened by
        the first `turn(message)`; a prompted task speaks first — take its opening
        reply with a bare `turn()` before answering. A prompt that belongs to the
        USER side (a scenario the caller pursues, not the assistant's seed) is the
        caller's to hide: hand the interaction a task whose `data.prompt` is None
        and keep the scenario on a scoring-side field (the user-sim env's contract).

        `runtime` and `tools` borrow live resources from their owners, just as
        they do for `run()`; an env supplies its taskset's shared tools
        automatically for tasks loaded from that taskset.

        Everything is a real rollout — the trace (live on `interaction.trace`),
        limits, `@stop`s, and scoring all apply; leaving the context ends the
        exchange (`user_closed`) and finishes the rollout, hooks and scoring
        included. A failure while opening the rollout raises before the context
        is entered (the failed trace is still completed and reported through
        `on_trace`). An exchange is caller-driven, so `config.retries` does not
        apply here."""
